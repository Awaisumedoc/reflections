How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
it will compare two files and highlight the defferences 
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
it will give the history of all the changes that are made by anyone who has been working on the document, and it can be resotred at any point of change. 
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
manually choosing commit gives the liberty to save changes
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git saves multiple files togather called repository. one commit makes changes in all files present in repository. 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
use git checkout with last commit. it will take to the previous commit. we can then check that wich commit created the bug.
